Updated test plan
Test Plan Identifier: A unique name or number to identify this specific test plan document.

Version History: Tracking changes, dates, authors, and reasons for revision.

Introduction/Overview:

Purpose of the test plan.

Brief description of the system/application/feature under test.

High-level goals and objectives of the testing effort described in this plan.

References to related documents (Project Plan, Requirements Specification, Design Documents, etc.).

II. Scope & Objectives:

Test Items: Clearly identify the software, hardware, features, modules, or functions that will be tested. This might include version numbers.

Features to be Tested: A more detailed breakdown of the specific features, user stories, or requirements covered by this plan. Often linked to requirements traceability.

Features Not to be Tested: Explicitly state what is out of scope for this testing effort and why (e.g., tested elsewhere, deferred, low risk, technical limitations).

Test Objectives: What specific goals does the testing aim to achieve? (e.g., verify functional correctness, assess performance against benchmarks, ensure security compliance, validate usability).

III. Strategy & Approach:

Test Approach/Strategy:

Overall methodology (e.g., risk-based, requirements-based).

Levels of testing involved (e.g., Unit, Integration, System, Acceptance).

Types of testing to be performed (e.g., Functional, Performance, Security, Usability, Regression, Compatibility, Installation).

Test techniques to be used (e.g., Equivalence Partitioning, Boundary Value Analysis, Exploratory Testing).

Degree of test automation planned.

Test Criteria:

Entry Criteria: Conditions that must be met before testing can begin (e.g., build deployed to test environment, smoke tests passed, required documentation available).

Suspension Criteria: Conditions under which testing will be temporarily halted (e.g., critical showstopper bug found, environment unavailable, significant change in requirements).

Resumption Criteria: Conditions under which testing will resume after suspension (e.g., blocking defect fixed and verified, environment restored).

Exit Criteria (Completion Criteria): Conditions that must be met for the testing phase covered by this plan to be considered complete (e.g., percentage of test cases executed/passed, defect density thresholds, no open critical/high severity defects, sign-off from stakeholders).

IV. Resources & Schedule:

Test Environment:

Hardware requirements.

Software requirements (OS, databases, browsers, supporting applications).

Network configuration.

Test tools (Test Management, Defect Tracking, Automation Tools, Performance Tools).

Test data requirements and setup procedures.

Roles and Responsibilities: Who is responsible for specific testing tasks (e.g., Test Manager, Test Lead, Testers, Developers for unit tests, Business Analysts for UAT). A RACI matrix can be useful here.

Staffing and Training Needs: Required skills for the test team and any necessary training.

Schedule:

Key milestones and deadlines for the testing effort.

Estimated effort for major testing tasks (planning, design, execution, reporting).

Dependencies on other project activities.

V. Management & Deliverables:

Test Deliverables: List of artifacts produced during the testing process (e.g., Test Plan itself, Test Cases, Test Scripts, Test Data, Test Execution Logs, Defect Reports, Test Summary Report).

Defect Management: The process for logging, tracking, prioritizing, assigning, resolving, and verifying defects. Reference to the defect tracking tool and workflows.

Risks and Contingencies: Potential risks to the testing effort (e.g., schedule delays, resource unavailability, technical issues, changing requirements) and planned mitigation or contingency actions.

Communication and Reporting: How test progress, status, and results will be communicated (e.g., daily stand-ups, weekly status reports, defect triage meetings).

VI. Approvals:

Approvals: Section for key stakeholders (e.g., Project Manager, Development Lead, Business Owner, Test Manager) to sign off, indicating their agreement with the plan. Includes space for names, titles, signatures, and dates.

Optional but Useful Attributes:

Glossary/Definitions: Defining key terms used within the plan.

Assumptions: Any assumptions made while creating the plan.
